# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTOR
Crop Yield Prediction Project
Welcome to the Crop Yield Prediction Project! This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to forecast crop yields, providing valuable insights for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

Project Overview
In the ever-evolving field of agriculture, accurate crop yield prediction is crucial for optimizing resources, planning logistics, and ensuring food security. This project addresses this need by developing a predictive model that takes into account various factors such as:

Soil Quality: Analyzing soil composition and nutrient levels.
Weather Conditions: Incorporating data on temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
Historical Data: Utilizing past crop yield records to improve predictions.
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize data for better model accuracy.
Feature Selection: Identify the most influential factors affecting crop yield.
Model Training: Implement machine learning algorithms to train the predictive model.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data handling.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
